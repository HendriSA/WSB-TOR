 This is the first of many in a series of "Windows Sandbox Tools" which I plan to assemble in an attempt to allow the deployment of secure and disposable Windows Sandboxes in just seconds! In particular this variation creates a disposable Tor environment for use in infosec operations or by privacy enthusiasts. 
 
 ## Prerequisites:
 To utilize this script, Windows Sandbox must be enabled within "Widows Features".
 To enable this feature:
 1. Press “Windows + R” on your keyboard to open the Run box and type “optionalfeatures”.
 2. Press OK.
 3. Within the Windows Features pop-up menu, select the "Windows Sandbox" checkbox. 
 4. Press OK (You may need to restart your PC.)
 
 **NOTE:** 
 A CPU with hardware virtualization enabled is required, as well as Virtualization capabilities enabled in BIOS.
